# Test installation - hints

This "exercise" is just a test to see if you have installed the tools correctly.

If you have, you should be able to run the following command in a terminal (you must be in the `steps` folder):

```bash
npm start -- 00
```

The output should look like this:

```text
You've done it! You are definitely ready for the workshop!
```

If you have any error, please check the [installation instructions](../../README.md#installation).
